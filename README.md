- Have implemented most of the SideBar UI and corresponding state
- Using Context API for state management
- Using Chakra UI for certain UI features (tooltips, dropdowns)
- Will review Tailwind config once UI is fully built, make variable names adhere to defined structure
- Definitions for types can most likely be combined into a single file for consistency (currently spread across 2 files, and occasionally defined at component level)

- Added 'Advanced Settings' accordion section and corresponding state
- Added pgae header and prompt input field
- Partial clean-up

- First pass at ImageGenerationHeader
- Negative prompt input and visibility state
- Placeholder states for model and imageStyle
- Styles for Model Selection drop down menu
- Plenty of clean-up and standardisation to be done vis-a-vis styles (currently a mash-up of Chakra UI inline, theme object & tailwind utils)
- Will also need to implement model and imageStyle states in SettingsContext
- Also contemplating whether a custom hook/controller might be a better option than Context API here. Will need to research further.

## Day 6 (28/04/2024) (later on):

- Lifted elements from page to layout level

### Next Steps:

- Continue implementation of ImageGenerationHeader
- Implement GenerationOptions
- Mobile responsiveness
- Clean-up
- Implement services for Leonardo API
