## Development Log

### Day 4 (26/04/2024):

<img width="1511" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 3 12 15 PM" src="https://github.com/Jamesokay/van-gogh-app/assets/78640728/75d83c9c-8540-49e4-92a2-a1454ae1719d">

- Have implemented most of the SideBar UI and corresponding state
- Using Context API for state management
- Using Chakra UI for certain UI features (tooltips, dropdowns)
- Will review Tailwind config once UI is fully built, make variable names adhere to defined structure
- Definitions for types can most likely be combined into a single file for consistency (currently spread across 2 files, and occasionally defined at component level)

### Day 5: (27/04/2024):

- First pass at ImageGenerationHeader
- Negative prompt input and visibility state
- Placeholder states for model and imageStyle

- Plenty of clean-up and standardisation to be done vis-a-vis styles (currently a mash-up of Chakra UI inline, theme object & tailwind utils)
- Will also need to implement model and imageStyle states in SettingsContext
- Also contemplating whether a custom hook/controller might be a better option than Context API here. Will need to research further.

### Day 18 (10/05/2024):

- Added services for hitting my API
- Plugged in API token from Leonardo
- Implemented fetch of generated images from Leonardo API rather than my DB
- Implemented image generation post request
- Not enabled for production environment yet, obviously
- Updated GenerationHistoryPanel to accomodate new data structure
- Made aspect ratio of image rows dynamic

### Day 18 (later):

- Added API call to fetch user details
- Removed redundant type definitions

### Day 19 (11/05/2024):

https://github.com/Jamesokay/van-gogh-app/assets/78640728/2aea4896-2ac8-4537-be27-a023702aae54

- Alright, so I have now removed those API routes, because this is Next 14 and I need to get with the program apparently. What we have now are server actions, defined in the ‘actions’ file. Farewell API, things just got simpler.
- I have added logic for polling the Leonardo API to retrieve a new generation. Ideally I would do this with web hooks, but at this time I cannot generate a consistent callback url that will tunnel to my local environment. The service provided by ngrok, for instance, resets the url every few hours. Since my Leonardo API key can only be associated with one web hook callback url, this is no bueno. There might be a way around this, but hey, one problem at a time.
- For now, I have build a client component called NewGenerationPanel, which handles the polling logic and associated render.
- Will probably use Suspense for this component, but have whacked together a basic loading state for the time being.
- Basic functionality for firing off a prompt and rendering the generated images is there now.

### Day 19 (later):

- Smoother out loading state (added spinner, minor styles)
- Added loading state to context, allowing components to synchronise based on this
- Added spinner to GenerateButton
- Extracted re-useable PanelHeader component
- Extracted NewGenerationLoading component

### Day 19 (even later):

- Implemented grid columns specifically for landscape generations and associated loading states
  
### To Do:

- Error handling throughout
- Standardise skeletons/loading states, use Suspense where appropriate
- Styling of loading states, prevent layout jumps
- API call for deleting generations
- Update settings keys to mirror those of request object
- Infinite scroll/fetch on Generation History
- Ensure settings state accurately translates to request body
- Fix button background flickering in hover overlay
- Fix tick button very faded in hover overlay
- Download image functionality
- Add further UI elements for when Image Guidance is enabled
- Implement Recent Images state and components (dropdown in ImageGuidanceUpload)
- Clean-up of styles
