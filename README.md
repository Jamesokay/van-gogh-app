- Have implemented most of the SideBar UI and corresponding state
- Using Context API for state management
- Using Chakra UI for certain UI features (tooltips, dropdowns)
- Will review Tailwind config once UI is fully built, make variable names adhere to defined structure
- Definitions for types can most likely be combined into a single file for consistency (currently spread across 2 files, and occasionally defined at component level)

### Next Steps:**

- Finish off SideBar
- Implement ImageGenerationHeader
- Implement GenerationOptions
- Mobile responsiveness
- Implement services for Leonardo API
